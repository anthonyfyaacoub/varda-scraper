# 🛡️ VARDA Lead Generation Scraper - Simple Setup

**Easy-to-use scraper that finds businesses with Google review violations.**

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyfyaacoub/varda-scraper.git
cd varda-scraper
```

Or download ZIP and extract it.

### Step 2: Run Setup Script

**Windows:**
```bash
python setup.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 setup.py
```

The script will:
- ✅ Install all Python dependencies

- ✅ Set up everything automatically

### Step 3: Run the Dashboard

**Windows:**
```bash
run.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

### Step 4: Open Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:8501**

## 📋 Manual Setup (If Script Doesn't Work)

```

### 2. Install Playwright Browsers

```

**Linux users may also need:**
```bash
playwright install-deps chromium
```

### 3. Create .env File

Create a file named `.env` in the project folder:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HEADLESS_MODE=false
```

### 4. Run Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
